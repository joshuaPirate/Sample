## Challenges

### SQL Injection

Learn about and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities. These challenges will guide you through identifying and exploiting SQL Injection points in web applications.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Practice both reflected and stored XSS attacks. Understand how to inject malicious scripts into web pages and how to protect against these attacks.

### Session Cookie Injection

Explore techniques for session hijacking and cookie manipulation. Learn how to inject session cookies and gain unauthorized access to web applications.

### Encryption Challenges

Test your skills with various encryption-related challenges. These will include tasks related to understanding and breaking different types of encryption.

## Setup

To set up the challenges, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seva41/CTF_Injection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CTF_Injection
   ```
This will set up the necessary environment to run the challenges. You can access the challenges at `http://localhost:PORT`, where `PORT` is the port number specified in the app setup.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of web security vulnerabilities

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
